## Hi I'm Jimena 👋

PhD in Computer Science | ML Engineer specialized in Cheminformatics and Molecular Property Prediction

## About me
I build end-to-end machine learning pipelines for drug discovery, toxicology prediction, and polymer informatics. My work sits at the intersection of chemistry, biology, and machine learning.

Throughout my career I've collaborated in multidisciplinary teams alongside chemists, pharmacologists, and materials scientists, bridging the gap between computational methods and domain expertise.

13 peer-reviewed publications in journals including Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, Scientific Reports, and Journal of Cheminformatics.

## Research areas
- QSAR/QSPR predictive modeling
- Ames mutagenicity & ADMET prediction
- Polymer & materials informatics
- Molecular descriptor selection & visual analytics

## Tech stack
Python · RDKit · Mordred · PyTorch · HuggingFace · Scikit-learn · Pandas · Git

## Currently
Continuously expanding expertise into modern deep learning architectures for molecular modeling, including transformer-based models for chemistry such as ChemBERTa.
